  As I've mentioned in the home page - this is something that I've wanted to put out for quite a while. But I am
  the kind to tend to want to do a lot of things and not do any of them. Or do them for a week and stop when
  I see no progress. So I am quite proud of myself for having put this out at all.

  The vision I had for this was a nice simple warm website where I could share thoughts and photographs. I wanted
  something simple, but neat. Turns out simple and neat to look at is not as simple and neat to build - so my
  vision shifted.
        </p>

        <p>
  My vision then became to just put something out. That is it. There are so many people in my life who have heard me
  tirelessly (and aimlessly) complain about wanting to build something. I don't know what it is that has kept me
  from doing this. Maybe some deeply rooted personal issues. I am kidding, of course. I obviously do not have any
  deeply rooted personal issues.

  Something that bothers/ed me is that I feel like I learn, but also feel like I have nothing to show for it. This project is 
  meant to be a solution for that too. A good friend of mine pointed out to me that it's as simple as writing (a
  blog) about something I've learnt. It doesn't have to be perfect. It doesn't have to be anything. It just has to be.

  <a href="https://ayushithakkar.substack.com/p/the-courage-to-create-badly" target="newtab">This article</a> I read inspired me (Thanks, Harini) to continue working on this page. It's something I always believed in, but never
  explicitly gave much thought. Something that felt right, but I never followed. This site is the first change
  away from that.

  I have used the word 'something' in this page a concerning amount - but I think that's just my current
state of inability to form coherent thought. As I hear is the case in one's twenties, it is quite an ambiguous,
turbulent state of life. Definitely not unhappy, just an <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2fNbDQSbCiq9NuVzVTPtlz?si=29ad24e037c54800"  target="newtab">odd phase of life</a>.
