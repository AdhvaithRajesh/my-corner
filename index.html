    <h3>This is long overdue. I've typed this out several times, but it's the first time it is actually reaching you.</h3>
    
    <p>This is a project which I've started and stopped and started and stopped and started and stopped and started.
What you're reading right now is the farthest I have come thus far, and I'm hoping that this will help me
overcome the inertia of building and of life in general.</p>

    <p>Over time, I intend to use this inertia to become an unstoppable momentous juggernaut, but that shall be a part
of phase-II of my personal development.</p>

    <p>This page is meant to be several imperfect things. It is not meant to be a well-designed portfolio, nor is it
meant to be a guide, a tutorial, or anything directioned of the sort. This is purely a collection of my personal 
thoughts and experiences - shown through blogs, articles, photographs, videos, and facts that I find 
interesting.</p>

    <p>Later on, I might even publish guides, tutorials, or directioned things - and if you are reading this as one of those
have been published - to you, I say - I can do whatever I want, it's my site.</p>

    <p>As I was saying a &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; ago, there's little that this site is <i>supposed to be</i>. It is meant to be vague. It is
meant to be specific. It is meant to reflect me, as I am right now. Which is mostly a mess.</p>

    <p>However, I have been inspired by several beautiful people in my life to put things out in the public. This site
is for me and for them. If you aren't one of them, this is also for you (although I hope you switch sides soon).</p>
